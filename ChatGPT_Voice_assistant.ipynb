      "Deep Work: Rules for Focused Success in a Distracted World is a non-fiction book by Cal Newport, a professor of computer science at Georgetown University. The book was published in 2016 and provides an insightful look into how to achieve maximum productivity in a distracted world. The book provides practical advice on how to focus and stay productive, while avoiding distraction and procrastination. Newport presents four rules to help people focus on the important tasks and stay productive: 1) Work Deeply, 2) Embrace Boredom, 3) Quit Social Media, and 4) Drain the Shallows. Through these rules, Newport encourages readers to develop the habit of deep work and focus on the most important tasks and projects. He also provides strategies for how to maintain focus and avoid distractions, and how to develop a work routine that supports deep work. The book also offers advice on how to use technology to support deep work, and how to achieve a balance between work and leisure.\n"
